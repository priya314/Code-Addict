        <h1 style="color:rgb(255, 0, 85)";>Trees Data Structure</h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(255, 0, 85)";><B>Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. We will discuss binary tree or binary search tree specifically.

                Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.</B></p>
                <h3 style="color:rgb(255, 0, 85)";>Important terms</h3>
                <p style="color:rgb(255, 0, 85)";>Path − Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.<br>

                        Root − The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.<br>
                        
                        Parent − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.<br>
                        
                        Child − The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.<br>
                        
                        Leaf − The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.<br>
                        
                        Subtree − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.<br>
                        
                        Visiting − Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.<br>
                        
                        Traversing − Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.<br>
                        
                        Levels − Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.<br>
                        
                        keys − Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.</p>
